It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc. In most English-speaking countries except for the United States, crunchy cookies are called biscuits. Many Canadians also use this term. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in the United Kingdom. Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars.",

    "As a newly graduated student from the Gilles Academy with a penchant for cookies\nYou stumbled upon a peculiar metallic box\nOn its side there is a display displaying 0/750. On the top there's a big red button on it. Finally on the bottom inscribes G to which you can't figure the significance out of.\nYou're compelled to press this button, though you don't know why.\nMaybe you could use something to click for you...",
    "As you produced more and more cookies, the display seemingly slows down to 3/750, staying there for quite a while\nYou posted a flyer hiring people to bake cookies for you\nA few days later, a grandma comes knocking at your door\nYou let her in, and she starts to bake cookies for you, in return of her getting a set amount of your cookies\nBut that's not the only person that comes inside\nOn the far corner you heard a faint sound of cats purring for milk...",
    "The cookies are piling up, but the display won't budge further than 12\nThen, a new button emerges from the underside, labeled 'Publish'\nYou're tempted to press it, but the display warns you about resetting in exchange for an even larger amount of cookies...",
    "1e25 cookies, that's 25/750\nThe far reaches of your cookies spread far and wide\nYou notices certain groups of people are beginning to worship cookies\nSo you built a temple for them\nHopefully the prayers to the cookie god would satisfy them enough to zap even more cookies in...",
    "Resources are finite, and you're coming up close to the limit of planet Earth\nUsing your gains from your banks, you set out to fund a space project, in hopes of getting more resources for your ever-growing desire for cookies\nIt's one of the dreams of the many to explore the world beyond us\nThe vast world, limitless combinations of everything possible by physics\nYou'd really like it if some of them are all made out of cookies...\nBut the restless G grows",
    "Wandering around landfills, it's a place full of useless refuse human throws out\nWhy bother looking far and wide when there's always something to find near us\nYou commissioned your scientists from the space program to assist in changing the non-cookie into cookies\nEven with the hardest of matter to change, it can always be fed into cookies.\nJust let the mother nature take care of the rest...",
    "What naive thoughts do they think that the universe is the limit?\nCountless worlds exist beyond us, in perpetual chaos within infinite universes\nA place where laws and observation holds meaningless\nAt no sign, a red dimensional rift appears inside one of your cookie piles\nIt caused quite big damages to your cookie count, but your assistants have pointed out that the world is called 'Cookieverse', a perilous place full with unimaginable monsters and indescribable topology\nExploring this place sure looks to be dangerous, but for some reason, the other world is all cookies\nYou quickly hopped in the chance to rob the world of cookies, slaying monsters, mass terraforming the place you name it!",
    "They said that time can't be stopped nor reversed\nYou, a young person decided to go against it\nFrom all the exploitation you made in the Cookieverse\nThey found a very chaotic piece of cookie ore that seems to warp and distort itself\nYour assistants determined it was the time continuum that the ore is messing with\nIn hopes of getting cookies through time itself, you assigned the scientist to break the law of time.",
    "18\n18 types of elementary particles\nNow there's 19 of them\nBut that's still 18 left to turn into cookies\nYou decided to commission the largest of the largest of particle accelerators to convert those particles into cookie particles\nYou gonna leak a lot of money for this, so you made the world dependent of cookies.",
    "How long has it been since you last saw the light of the day?\nYou went outside(and touched grass), only to find the sun instantly making you sweat bullets\nComing back into your den(grand office) you looked into the mirror and find yourself splattered with cookies\nIt seems that light itself is being turned into cookies as well\nMight just as well focus all of them into a big burst of cookies\nAnd in the meantime spray a bit of radiance to those worshippers as well",
    "POOF! and there goes nothing!\nYou just saw one of your cookies disappear into nothingness\nThen you saw a black cat in the corner of your vision again\nIn a panic,you hastily read through the book on symbolisms, and found out that black cat means bad luck\nWith your amounts of cookies, fearing that it might all be GONE the next day,\nYou improvised up a device from that book that would apparently bring in good luck to your entire existence\nAnd your local spellcasters might take an interest in that too",
    "Does your cookie look empty?\nI know that might sound like nonsense but how much of the matter is really matter\nUsing your sheet amount of knowledge you got from working with your past projects\nYou somehow managed to convert mattern't to matter and the cookie just splits into a whole lot more cookies\nPresenting the plan, you assigned the engineers to work on standardizing the device used to convert mattern't to matter, although the material used might have been too exotic",
    "Having lost your mind being overwhelmed with the thoughts of cookie\nYou went out on a ramage with your cookies, tearing down any and all signs of resistance, even the fabric of reality itself\nYou went mad, in search of something you can use to bend reality\nOne of the madness you did is parting some poor soul(Orteil?) of their laptop\nOn the laptop there's a console with the word 'Javascript' written on it\nYou of course, politely pressure the programmers to decipher the complicated syntax of 'Javascript'",
    "I love cookies, why don't we enslave other idle games to produce cookies for us",
    "Nothing stops you anymore\nNot even getting the counter to 750(it's now 500/750)\nIn one of the everlasting days at the Cookie Megacorporation...\nYou managed to manifest your desire of cookies out of thin air\nSeeing this opportunity, you cleared your way through the legal system to get some subjects to perform something on\nIt was a success, seeing them thinking up cookies out of thin air\nWhy bother with all your buildings when you can just think up cookies...",
